# useReducer Hook in React

## Introduction
The `useReducer` hook in React is an alternative to `useState` for managing state, especially when state logic is complex or involves multiple state transitions. It is similar to Redux but works within a React component without additional libraries.

## When to Use `useReducer`
Use `useReducer` when:
- State logic is complex (e.g., multiple related state values)
- The next state depends on the previous state
- You want to centralize state management logic in one function
- You prefer a Redux-like approach without installing Redux

## Syntax
```javascript
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
```
- `reducer`: A function that determines how state changes based on actions
- `initialState`: The starting state value
- `state`: The current state
- `dispatch`: A function to trigger state updates

## Example: Counter with `useReducer`

```javascript
import React, { useReducer } from 'react';

const initialState = { count: 0 };

function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'increment':
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case 'decrement':
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    case 'reset':
      return initialState;
    default:
      throw new Error('Unknown action type');
  }
}

function CounterWithReducer() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {state.count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'increment' })}>Plus One</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'decrement' })}>Minus One</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'reset' })}>Reset</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default CounterWithReducer;
```

## Explanation
1. The `reducer` function handles different actions (`increment`, `decrement`, `reset`).
2. The `CounterWithReducer` component initializes state using `useReducer`.
3. The `dispatch` function is used to update state by sending actions.
4. When a button is clicked, the corresponding action is dispatched, updating the state accordingly.

## Benefits of `useReducer`
- Centralized state logic for better maintainability
- Easier debugging since all state changes happen in one place
- Useful when migrating to Redux later

## When to Use `useState` Instead
- If your component has simple state logic (e.g., a single boolean or number)
- If you donâ€™t need complex state transitions

## Conclusion
`useReducer` is a powerful alternative to `useState` for handling complex state logic in React components. It provides better state organization and scalability while keeping your component logic clean.
